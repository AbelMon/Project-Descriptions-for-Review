##Project Overview
You will make an iPhone app that will allow users to record their voice and will then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app will also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback.

##Why this project?
The first step in becoming an iOS Developer is to create your first app. Pitch Perfect provides a substantial, while not overly complicated, introduction to the iOS ecosystem.

##What will I learn?
You will learn how to:

* Create a new project from existing iOS app templates
* Add buttons, images, labels and create user interfaces for the app using the Storyboard
* Leverage the Model View Controller (MVC) design principles; this includes writing custom model code, and using UIViewController, and UIView
* Create Outlet and Action connections between the views and view controllers. 
Benefit from the power of Delegates by using them in code
* Navigate between two scenes in the app using UINavigationController
* Play audio files using AVFoundation’s AVAudioEngine class
* Run the iOS simulator and download the app on a physical device 
* Search documentation, resolve bugs and read other people’s code

##How do I complete this project?
<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ud585-nd" target="_blank">Intro to iOS App Development with Swift</a> walks you step-by-step through creating the Pitch Perfect App. If you want to complete the project without taking the course, you can download a detailed specification <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_wLvkeCYfm7OXIwN0RRYjM1Qjg&authuser=0" target="_blank">here</a>.

Once you have a completed app, you need to make changes to the code using <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uotwFB5A3qmQL4-NTNuI4UT_UqqPrsZ17wZMY6XhlB0/pub" target="_blank">feedback from from a professional iOS Developer.</a>

##Evaluation
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity Code Reviewer according to the rubric below. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.
