##Project Overview
In this capstone project, you will create an app of your own design that showcases your iOS development chops. The app should demonstrate solid proficiency in these four areas:

* Building sophisticated and polished user interfaces with UIKit components
* Downloading data from network resources
* Persisting state on the device
* Researching and integrating new libraries 

You are encouraged to find an interesting restful API to interact with. Social media sites, weather, sports, photo repositories, municipal data, and imdb are provide examples of APIs you can use.  The app should provide some kind of interactive experience with the data. The user interface should contain multiple view controllers. We anticipate that most user interfaces will use navigation controllers to structure multiple pages of content, and will include tables, collections, and or tabs. But any use interface that provides a useful and interesting way to interact with the data is acceptable. 

The project should have some requirement for persistent state. If the app is shut down and restarted, it should not need to refresh its state entirely from the network data source. 

The app should also be submitted with a readme.txt file that describes experience that the user is expected to have, and any particular instructions a use might need. 

##Why this project?
This project is open-ended, so it provides an opportunity for you to showcase your iOS abilities. It allows you to make expressive, engaging user interfaces, and to gather and generate compelling data. 

##What will you learn?
* Researching and leveraging a new framework or library
* How to design and build an app from the ground up
* Finding sources of networked data

##Why is this project meaningful to my career?
Landing a job as an iOS Developer requires more than technical chops; it also requires a certain amount of creativity and innovation. Having with an app 100% of your own creation in their portfolio demonstrate a passion for the field that will set you apart from your competition.
