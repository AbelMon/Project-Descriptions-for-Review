## Project overview
In this project, you will consider an actual experiment that was run by Udacity. The specific numbers have been changed, but the patterns have not. You will flesh the experiment idea out into a fully defined design, analyze the results, and propose a high-level follow-on experiment. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1aCquhIqsUApgsxQ8-SQBAigFDcfWVVohLEXcV6jWbdI/pub?embedded=True" target="_blank">project instructions</a> contain more details.

## Project format
The project will have both qualitative and quantitative components. You should verify your answers to the quantitative components using the quizzes in this lesson, then combine both qualitative and quantitative answers into an overarching report using  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16OX2KDSHI9mSCriyGIATpRGscIW2JmByMd0ITqKYvNg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this template</a>. (If you would like to create your report using Google Docs, you can copy this template using "File > Make a copy" if you are signed into Google Drive.) We recommend not adding your quantitative answers to your report until you have correctly passed all the quizzes.
