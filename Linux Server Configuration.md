##Project Overview
You will take a baseline installation of a Linux distribution on a virtual machine and prepare it to host your web applications, to include installing updates, securing it from a number of attack vectors and installing/configuring web and database servers.

##Why this Project?
A deep understanding of exactly what your web applications are doing, how they are hosted, and the interactions between multiple systems are what define you as a Full Stack Web Developer. In this project, you’ll be responsible for turning a brand-new, bare bones, Linux server into the secure and efficient web application host your applications need.

##What will I Learn?
You will learn how to access, secure and perform the initial configuration of a bare-bones Linux server. You will then learn how to install and configure a web and database server and actually host a web application.

##How does this Help my Career?
* Deploying your web applications to a publicly accessible server is the first step in getting users
* Properly securing your application ensures your application remains stable and that your user’s data is safe
