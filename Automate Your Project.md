By the time you've gone through the second course, you'll have added a substantial number of new topics to your notes **and** written some code in a new language (Python).

Because of this, you'll submit 3 files.


1. The HTML for your notes.
2. The CSS for your notes.
3. A Python file (saved as `html_generator.py`)

Your project reviewer will review and provide feedback on two aspects of your submission: the Python code you've written and the text content you've added for your notes file.

### 1 - Code Review
Your reviewer will look at the Python code you've written and provide feedback on:

* **Use of Variables**: Your code should take advantage of variables and variable **names** should reflect the **values** they store. 

* **Functions**: Your code should use functions appropriately to avoid repetition. Function parameters should have logical names and should all be used in the body of the function.

* **Appropriate use of Data**: Data types (`strings` vs `lists` for example) should be used appropriately. 

* **Appropriate use of other coding techniques**: Your code should use statements like `if`, `then`, `else`, `while`, etc... appropriately.

### 2 - Content Review
In addition to looking at the code you write, your project reviewer will also read your notes to help ensure you have a good understanding of the most important concepts covered so far. They will be looking for:

* **Understanding of Programming**: Your notes should demonstrate an understanding of what it means to program a computer. 

* **Understanding of Functions**: Your notes should demonstrate an understanding of what functions are and why they are useful.

* **Basic Programming Knowledge**: Your project reviewer won't be looking for anything specific in this area, but will be providing general feedback where appropriate about other programming ideas.

The rubric that will be used is included below:
