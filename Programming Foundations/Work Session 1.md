## Reviewer Instructions
The code you will see is the first code these students have written. Because of this, it’s especially important that reviews are positive! You may be the first expert programmer that this person has interacted with. Use this opportunity to welcome them into the programming community with open arms.

The submissions you see will be simple HTML that will probably only use some of the following tags:
* \<b>
* \<em>
* \<a> - with href attribute
* \<img> - with src attribute 
* \<p>
* \<span> and \<div> (though they probably won’t know how to use these effectively yet)

# At this point, students have not learned
* How (or why) to use \<head> or \<body> tags
* How to properly indent code
* Any CSS or styling
* How to use Developer Tools in their browser
* How to use a professional code editor (they’ve been using tools like scratchpad.io)

# ![Andy](http://i.imgur.com/fdGeWES.png) How Am I Doing? Submit Work Session 1
Throughout your Nanodegree program, you will submit your work at 5 stages for review.  You will see each of these in your <a href="https://udacity.com/course/nd000" target="_blank">Nanodegree portal</a>.  When you submit your work at these stages, you will receive a grade that indicates either that you've passed that stage, or that you need to work on your project and resubmit again.  
 
To give you an <em>early opportunity</em> to experience the submission process and get feedback <em>immediately</em> after you put your newest skills into practice, please submit your work for Work Session 1.  You'll see this indicated on the <a href="https://udacity.com/course/nd000" target="_blank">portal</a> as: "Getting Started with Work Sessions."  
###Details:
<ul>
<li>You <b>will not receive a grade</b> for this first submission
