# Reviewer Instructions for Getting Started with HTML
## Who are these students?
These students are enrolled in the Intro to Programming Nanodegree program. They are beginners and brand new to the world of programming. 
## How does this project fit into the overall program?
Over the course of the program, students will build a web page.  This project is the first stage.   
## What should I comment on and expect from students?
We’d like you comment not only on the html, but also the content within the html.
* HTML 
 ** The html you will see is the first code these students have ever written.  Because of this, it’s especially important that reviews are positive! The feedback you provide them is intended for their learning and they will be continuing to add functionality to their web page through the rest of their Nanodegree program.
** You should look for:
  * Use of Logical HTML Structure 
    *  All opening tags are closed
Use of basic tags such as:
<b>
<em>
<a> with href attribute
<img> with src attribute 
<p>
<span> and <div> (though they probably won’t know how to use these effectively yet)
You should not expect:
<head> or <body> tags
Proper indentation
Any CSS or styling
For students who meet or exceed expectations at this stage: feel free to introduce a new concept such as <head> or <body> tags, proper indentation, etc.. 
Content within HTML
The content of the web page will be notes students have taken on the high level concepts in the first lesson.  As a reviewer, you aren’t expected to check that they have any specific concepts included, but if you see a student has written something that demonstrates any confusion around a specific concept, feel free to clarify it for them. 
Note that you can leave these comments using the same line-by-line interface for code review comments.

Throughout your Nanodegree program, you will submit your work at 5 stages for review.  You will see each of these in your <a href="https://udacity.com/course/nd000" target="_blank">Nanodegree portal</a>.  When you submit your work at these stages, you will receive a grade that indicates either that you've passed that stage, or that you need to work on your project and resubmit again.  
 
To give you an <em>early opportunity</em> to experience the submission process and get feedback <em>immediately</em> after you put your newest skills into practice, please submit your work for Work Session 1.  You'll see this indicated on the <a href="https://udacity.com/course/nd000" target="_blank">portal</a> as: "Getting Started with Work Sessions."  
###Details:
<ul>
<li>You <b>will not receive a grade</b> for this first submission
<li>There <b>will not be any consequences</b> for missing this deadline.  
<li>This is the <b>only work session you will submit.</b>  
<li>This is a <b>formative checkpoint</b> designed to give you immediate feedback and ensure you have the confidence and the support you need to keep moving forward.  

Next: Follow the steps on the next two slides to submit Work Session 1.
