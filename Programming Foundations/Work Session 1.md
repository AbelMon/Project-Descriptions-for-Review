## Reviewer Instructions
The code you will see is the first code these students have written. Because of this, it’s especially important that reviews are positive! You may be the first expert programmer that this person has interacted with. Use this opportunity to welcome them into the programming community with open arms.

The submissions you see will be simple HTML that will probably only use some of the following tags:
* <b>
* <em>
* <a>
* with href attribute
* <img>
* with src attribute 
* <p>
* <span> and <div> (though they probably won’t know how to use these effectively yet)

# At this point, students have not learned
* How (or why) to use <head> or <body> tags
* How to properly indent code
* Any CSS or styling
* How to use Developer Tools in their browser
* How to use a professional code editor (they’ve been using tools like scratchpad.io)
