##Project Overview
For this project, students will make their own Android app. They can either come up with their own idea or select from one of the ideas listed under App Ideas on the <a href= "https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud853/project#android-fundamentals-project-description" target="_blank"> Final Project Description page.</a>  They are also welcome to repurpose code from Sunshine to create a new app. 


##Why this project?
This project is a way for students to demonstrate the concepts they learned in the Developing Android Apps course by building them out.  

##What will students learn?
Students will learn how to:
* Create an app that meets standard design Android's CoreApp Quality Guidelines
* Identify the minimum permissions required to support core functionality
* Implement a ContentProvider to access locally stored data
* Implement a SyncAdapter or IntentService when pulling/sending data from a web service
* Use a Loader to move data to an app's views
* Preserve and restore user or app state upon device rotation or from the Home/Back buttons
* *Optional:* Implement Notifications, ShareActionProvider, Broadcast Events, and Custom Views


##How do students complete this project?
1. Complete the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud853/l-1938208734/m-1922408690" target="_blank">Developing Android Apps course</a>
2. Students will create an open-ended project following the Project Description and Rubric listed here
3. The project must:
 * Import and build on the latest version of Android Studio (Eclipse users take note)
 * Be entirely self-contained on an Android device (No external devices/bluetooth peripherals).
 * Include only safe-for-work content in your app
 * Meet specifications on all required components of the rubric (including submitting their Project Description, Self-Evaluation, Mockups for all user-facing screens including tablet mocks, and a signed .apk)
 

##Evaluation
###Overview
The project will be evaluated against the rubric below. 
The criteria included in this rubric are a subset of the Core App Quality Guidelines that the app would be evaluated against if it were submitted to the Google Play Store. Find the full list of guidelines here: http://developer.android.com/distribute/essentials/quality/core.html

###How Grading Works (instructions to student)
1. Your project evaluator will be able to see all of your code submissions. They will use this rubric to evaluate your code as well as your written responses from the <a ref="https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/course/ud853/Android+Fundamentals+Project+Self-Evaluation.doc" target="_blank">Self-Evaluation.</a>
2. Your grade will simply be "meets specifications," “exceeds specifications,” or "does not meet specifications,"
  1. You earn “meets specifications” if **all** criteria in the Required Components section “meet specifications”.
  2. You earn “exceeds specifications” if **all** criteria in the Required Components section “meet specifications” and you receive “exceed specifications” in **all** criteria under at least 2 of the 4 categories of the Optional Components section.
  3. Your project “does not meet specifications” if any criteria in the Required Components section are graded as “does not meet specifications.” In this case, you will have the opportunity to revise and resubmit your work.
